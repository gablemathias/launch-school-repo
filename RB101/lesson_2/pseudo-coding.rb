# 1. returns the sum of two integers
# get the first number and store it
# get the second number and store it
# perform the addition using the first number and the second number and store it
# return the resulting valu

# 2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is
# all those strings concatenated together
# get an array of strings
# set an empty variable
# while looping through each value of the array store the value inside the empty variable
# concatenating with the previous value
# return that variable

# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other
# element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:
# get an array of integers
# set an empty array
# loop through the array
# check if its not the last item of the array to stop
# store one value in it and discard the next value
# return the filled array

# 4. a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string.
# get a string
# set the given character of that string
# set an empty variable
# loop through the string
# sum the number of occurrencies of that given character and store it
# if the character dont occur as least 3 times returns null
# when reaching the 3rd occurrency get the index of the last occurency
# stop the loop  and returns it

# 5. a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays.
# get the first array
# get the second array
# set a new empty array
# loop the length of array
# store the value of the first array followed the value of the second array
# return the new array
